## Accessing the Frontend
The frontend is served as static files by the backend server. After starting the backend server, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
This will load the frontend UI (index.html and related assets).

### Building the Frontend
If you want to build the frontend assets for production, run:
```
npm run build:frontend
```
This will bundle the frontend files using webpack.
